# Surface-Defect-Detection-for-NEU-Database
Surface Defect Detection for NEU database in python / Google Colab

This project is related to the Intelligent Control course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Tuzla.
The goal of the project was to demonstrate the use of artificial intelligence (neural networks) for the purpose of detecting defects on metal.

In the folder:
``
NEU Metal Surface Defects Data
``
there is a dataset needed for training. There is code for google colab in the pyrhon scripts. Each script uses a different Neural Network for training, testing and validation.
